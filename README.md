<h1>This is the backend of Thoughts-app</h1>
    <h4>(This will probably be renamed late)</h4>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I have uploaded it along the python venv, the django projects in stored as "main-project" and the api is stored as "api" inside the django project</p>
    <p>The app is structured as :</p>
    <ul>
        <li> models.py -  It has the database table structures</li>
        <li>views.py - It handles in the incoming REST requests</li>
        <li>serilazers.py - It handles the incoming json and converts it into python dictionaries so it can be handled</li>
        <li>urls.py - Handles all the routing to the app i.e which urls are for which functions in views</li>
    </ul>
